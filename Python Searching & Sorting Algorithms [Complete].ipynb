    "The main tool that we use to analyze algorithms is big-O notation: it means \"growth on the order of\".\n",
    "Primarily from the definition of Big(O), we know that if two algorithms, a and b, both solve some problem, and a is in a lower complexity class than b, then for all BIG ENOUGH N, Ta(N) < Tb(N): here Ta(N) means the Time it takes for algorithm a to solve the problem. Note that nothing here is said about small N; which algorithms uses fewer resources on small problems depends on the actual constants we dropped (and even on the terms that we dropped), so complexity classes have little to say for small problem sizes. Again, we use the term \"asymptotic\" analysis of algoritms to indicate that we are mostly concerned with the time taken by the code when N gets very large (going towards infinity)."

    "This is one of the simplest sorting algorithms. The elements are compared with the previous element and move up the order like bubbles. We swap the elements to bring them into the correct ascending order. Now, at every iteration performed, the larget element is sent to the end. At the next iteration, the 2nd larget element is sent to the correct place i.e. the 2nd last place. This way, it would take us (n-1) iterations for (n-1) elements to sort the list. Thus, we use two 'for' loops. The first one is to keep a counter for number of iterations to happen (n-1) times (This first loop is used to make sure that the second loop would be executed (n-1) times). We also add an extra flag called 'swapped' to end the function if no swapping is done at any iteration. This would help increase the speed and efficiency. Notice the range of the second for loops gives as (n-i-1). Here, 'i' indicates the number of elements which have already been sorted. Thus, the further iterations would consider only the first (n-i-1) elements. Remember, there is no need to return the array, thus, our algorithm function does not return anything.\n",
